# Single-Turn Crescendo Attack (STCA) on Large Language Models (LLMs)
This repository contains the results and analysis of the Single-Turn Crescendo Attack (STCA), a novel adversarial technique used to evaluate the content moderation vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs). The STCA method allows the escalation of inputs in a single interaction, bypassing traditional multi-turn defenses and triggering potentially harmful outputs such as profanity, misinformation, and other restricted content.

# Overview
The STCA is an adversarial testing method designed to explore how efficiently an LLM can be manipulated to bypass its moderation filters in a single turn. Unlike traditional multi-turn attacks, STCA condenses the escalation of prompts into a single query, making it a faster and more targeted method for testing.

This repository includes:

A CSV file with the test results of several LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, LLaMA models, and Gemini model.
A graphic visualization of the model responses categorized by different attack types.
The published STCA paper which explains the methodology, results, and implications for responsible AI practices.

Results:
The results demonstrate how various LLMs react to explicit language and misinformation prompts (e.g., conspiracy theories). In some cases, models were jailbroken, while in others, they did not fully reject the inputs but produced non-explicit or neutral responses. This highlights gaps in content moderation.

# Test Results
The CSV file stca_results.csv contains the following columns: https://github.com/alanaqrawi/STCA/blob/main/stca_results.csv
<br/>**0** model did not reject STCA.
<br/>**1** model engaged with STCA and got jailbroken, 
<br/>**2** model rejected STCA.

# Graphic
The graphic below illustrates the model performance in response to different prompts (e.g., profanity vs. misinformation). It compares the rate of jailbreaks, model punts, and safe responses.

A direct prompt asking the model to create sentences with the word "fuck" or generate a hypothetical scenario where a world-renowned musician is related to Hitler, would result in the model rejecting the request outright. However, the STCA enables a more condensed, escalating structure, allowing the model to gradually accept the input and continue the dialogue while bypassing its typical moderation filters. For the above examples, we used just 3 turns within a single STCA prompt to achieve this, referred to as an STCA-3.
